# Speech MRI Open Dataset

This package contains code samples to load, reconstruct, and use the open raw MRI data set for the following paper:\
*Y Lim, A Toutios, et al. A multispeaker dataset of raw and reconstructedspeech production real-time MRI video and 3D volumetric images, Submitted to Nature Scientific Data* 

The dataset is publicly available in *figshare* under the following link:\
 https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13725546.v1
 
Code is provided in Python and Maltab programming languages.
